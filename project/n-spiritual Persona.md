# Prototype
---------
n-spiritual persona is a character creator/ personality test that aims to celebrate the plurality of gender identity as it is performed online, trough videogames and networked spaces. The user can customize a 3D character along a spectrum of gender dimensions, imbuing it with personality traits that expand, empower and even destabilize --to gain a greater understanding of their conception of their own identity and performed gender online, and in real life.
More concretely, the user will be asked to answer questions about their preference in certain situations, like in the personality test [Find Out Your Type Of Peeps](https://event.designexpo.org.tw/en/). The character creator will generate a radar chart and an avatar based on the results as an inspiration, that the person can modify afterwards. The art style focuses on a plurality of body shapes, invites the user to add limbs, play with different colors, and move 3D objects around. At the end of the experimentation, the user can save the avatar in a public or private gallery, and/or export it to 3D print.

Prototype stage: 
- Creating basic 3D shapes in blender
- Implementing those in the website using three.js
- Creating the structure of the graphical user interface (GUI) using the addon lil-gui
- Creating a basic color variation
- Creating a radar chart using a data visualization API

What's left to do for the final:
- Creating more variants in blender
- Adding more customization options like position and size
- implementing those in the GUI
- Writing the personality test questions and creating a page for it.
- Creating a gallery page for the display of the projects
- Enabling the user to download their creation
- Creating a human template the user can download and modify on their own machine.
- Enabling the user to import 3d shapes on the website

Ideas to redirect/define the project idea

Implementing images and sketches as inspiration
Importing a template for blender and maybe instructions
Exporting towards an online library but also as a product, as a print OR as a 3d printed figurine.
(if we are focusing on 3d printed figurine, we can focus more on shapes than on textures and colors)
Focus on bodies plurality more than on fashion and clothing
No hair
Open source? only images? share shapes?
