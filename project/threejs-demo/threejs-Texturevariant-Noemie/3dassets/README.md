Here is the texture library extention
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_variants
And an example using the material variant

Everything needs to be set in blender.
I changed the orientation of the model to rotate on the z axis -90 degrees, and created a color variant using these two tutorials. 
(Make sure your blender version is up to date, or you won't be able to set variants with the gltf2.0 addon.)

Only the base color is updated for now.
