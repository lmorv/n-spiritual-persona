# Final project documentation

## Playtest feedback:

"This came out great! The site runs very smoothly, especially considering all the 3D model manipulation. I didnâ€™t see any lagging or stuttering when people were making changes. I love the abstraction of the characters, keeping demographic traits out of the model is great both practically and narratively. I would suggest some tweaks to the quiz UI to make it feel a bit more in line with the aesthetics of the rest of the site. Really great job!!" _ Jennifer Brown

"Very cool litte character creator! quiz was a lot of fun and was honestly surprised at how the sliders interacted with the models, managed to stay as intuitive as most character creators are yet still throw you off with some inventive character manipulation." _ Thomas RomprÃ©

"So cool!! I love how you can create and customize your own character and that every character that you create is different than the other. The UI is super simple to understand. I also like the little quiz there was in the beginning where we could abstractly see the result. It feels like the beginning of a game where you're character built can be part of a community based-game."_ Mariam Aoune 

"Super duper nice project! The quiz was funny and I really enjoyed fiddling with all the body options to create our character! It would maybe be nice to see which answer affected what in the appearance exactly! Adding some more color options for each part of the body would be cool too!"_ Maloney Khim

"Such a cool project, the questions on the quiz were super fun to answerðŸ˜„
The 3D models were super well done, it was super smooth to make the modifications.
Hopefully, I'll be able to see the final result when everything is linked! Great job guys" _  Hannah Kim
