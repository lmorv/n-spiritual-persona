Ideas to redirect/define the project idea

Implementing images and sketches as inspiration
Importing a template for blender and maybe instructions
Exporting towards an online library but also as a product, as a print OR as a 3d printed figurine.
(if we are focusing on 3d printed figurine, we can focus more on shapes than on textures and colors)
Focus on bodies plurality more than on fashion and clothing
No hair

Open source? only images? share shapes?
